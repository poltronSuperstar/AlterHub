# AlterHub

Welcome to AlterHub, a unique communication platform designed specifically for individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This software facilitates seamless communication among different alters, providing a personalized and secure environment for each alter to express themselves.
Features

- Personalized Profiles for Each Alter: Each alter can create a unique profile with customizable options such as color themes and fonts, allowing for a distinct and personal space within the app.

- Alter-to-Alter Communication: Alters can communicate with all alters collectively or engage in private conversations with specific alters, ensuring privacy and control over their interactions.

- Customizable Themes: Users can choose from a variety of themes to personalize the look and feel of the app according to their preferences or the preferences of each alter.

- Speech-to-Text (STT) Functionality: To enhance ease of use, AlterHub includes a speech-to-text feature, enabling users to speak their messages, which are then converted into text.

- Future Neural Network Integration: We are exploring the integration of a neural network to identify which alter is speaking. This feature is in the proof of concept stage and shows promising results in initial tests.
